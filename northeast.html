    <hr>
    <p class="Esan">Most of the tradition and culture of Thailand’s northeastern region is influenced by the culture of the Tai-Laos minority, who long ago made scattered settlements along the east bank of the Mekong River before evacuating to the west bank of the river or the northeastern of part of Thailand, which is known as “Isaan.” The Tai-Laos population adapted their traditions and culture to the new way of living, society, political situation, and religious beliefs of their new home until they originated what we call Thai-Isaan traditions and culture.
    Isaan people build their houses in the unique and auspicious style of “Long Ta Wen.” The shorter side of the Isaan house usually faces east or west while the longer side of the house will face north or south. They believe that building a house this way will make the owner happy and lucky. Like the houses in the central region, the Isaan houses are elevated up from the ground, providing a large space under the house that can be used for many purposes such as family activities, agricultural jobs, weaving, or for storing rice, fermented fish, and other products. It is a multipurpose area useful for the whole family.
    The roofs of Isaan houses are either thatched with clumps of hay woven together or made of corrugated iron for better protection when the rainy season comes. All sides of the house will be covered with banana leaves. Since the Isaan community is an open society, there are no fences or other dividers between the houses. At least that was the tradition in the past, but it is rarely seen today. Most people in the region have now changed their style of house construction along with the times and the economic situation. Now you can hardly see any Isaan houses built with hay roofs or other local materials, except for some poorer families who don’t have enough money to upgrade their house.</p>

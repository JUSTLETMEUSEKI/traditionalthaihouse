    <hr>
    <p class="North">The traditional Thai house built in the northern region of Thailand is actually different from traditional houses built in other regions of the country. Thai houses in the north have to be more protective against the cool climate. The architecture of northern style Thai houses is derived from local beliefs and ancient Lanna culture. One beautiful example of the traditional Thai Lanna art, culture, and architecture can be seen at Doi Tung, the Princess Motherâ€™s villa and gardens, also known as Mae Fah Luang (Mother of the Sky).
    The traditional Thai Lanna house or khum and Baan Boran (ancient house) was erected for people of high rank. The traditional Thai house in the north is usually built in a twin style with a duplex of two adjacent houses. The general appearance is designed to protect against the cooler climate of the north. The ceiling is lower and the house is not raised as high above the ground, and there are fewer windows compared to the traditional Thai houses built in the central region and in the Isaan area.
    The northern house usually has a vast area of balcony in the front of the house to welcome the fresh air and the dreamy sound of the bird chorus in the morning. The balcony plays as the reception or multi-purpose area.</p>

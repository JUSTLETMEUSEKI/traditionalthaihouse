    <hr>
    <p>The style and architecture of the traditional Thai house (Ruen Thai) were influenced by the people’s belief in Buddhism and in supernatural powers. Also, Thai houses were built in accordance with the people’s way of life in the past, the tropical geography of the country, and certainly to fit in with the agricultural way of life. The traditional Thai house was designed to resist humidity, heavy rain, hot temperatures, floods, and invasion by hazardous creatures that might harm the family. The front of the house usually faces the East. The status or wealth of the owner is reflected in the size of the house.
    The traditional Thai houses of the central region were very simple, built using local materials, with no separate bedrooms or partitions in the house. Normally, the floor plan is a rectangle, with no second floor, and a high ceiling for better ventilation of hot temperatures and humid atmosphere. A unique component of the wooden structures of traditional Thai architecture is the use of a bracketing system to join pieces of wood without using any nails or metal parts.
    Traditional Thai houses are usually built elevated up from the ground in case of floods and for security reasons. The shady space underneath is suitable for keeping animals such as cows and poultry, or for storing rice, produce, and agriculture tools and equipment.</p>

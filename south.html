<h1 class="BoudaryOfDeath"> Thailand Houses in the South</h1>
<hr>
    <p class="South">The southern part of Thailand is very different from other parts of the country. It has two seasons, rainy and summer season. People in the southern provinces have to face heavy rain and scattered thunder showers several times a year. And when the hot or summer season comes, itâ€™s not as sultry as the other parts of the country since there are mild winds from the northwest and southeast. The winds also bring rain during the summer so people living in the south have to bear with rain for nearly the whole year, which has also influenced their way of building houses.
    The traditional Thai house in the south has a high ceiling and more slope to let the rainwater fall down easily into storage pots. The pillars of the house are made of hard wood and have cement bases to prevent rotting in the humid weather. There is no fence around the house, but people usually grow edible trees and other plants such as banana, mango, coconut, and jackfruit to show the border of each house.</p>
